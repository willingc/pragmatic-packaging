# pragmatic-packaging
A user focused approach to packaging 

## Motivation

As a basic user, I wish to do task abc successfully. 
As an advanced Python and C++/Fortran user, I wish to do xyz successfully. The user's pathway to success will be different: process steps and secondarily tool selection.

In general, I believe over-emphasis on the tools has made all of the packaging tutorials and discussions for years less than ideal for a user.
Perhaps coming at the problem from the specific outcome desired and the associated processes would be more productive and much easier to keep up to date.

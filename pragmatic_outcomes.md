# Pragmatic User Goals and Outcomes

## Users and their needs

User needs and user sophistication vary when it comes to packaging a library or application.
When libraries and applications use Python, the user will need to adopt a packaging tool for Python so that their project can be distributed to others.
Complexity increases when the user's application also includes: C, C++, extensions, Fortran, JavaScript/TypeScript, Hardware choices (i.e. GPU), data, notebooks, and documentation.

Common Questions
----------------
1. Am I installing a package or do I need to create a package?
    - Let's continue the discussion about installing a package in another section.
    - Let's continue here with the questions that need answers when creating a package.
2. What needs to be packaged?
    - Pure Python
    - Other things in addition to Python
3. What tools would be suitable to do what I need based on my response to questions 1 and 2?
4. From the tools that are potential options for my use case, how do I determine the pros/cons of which tool to select?
5. Taking the plunge to create the package, how do I use my selected tool successfully?


## Pragmatic Packaging

Users have limited time, levels of experience, and familiarity with Python packaging.
Yet, they do have one thing in common: a desire to successfully package their application or library.

In Pragmatic Packaging, we put the user at the forefront and the tools as secondary in our approach.
Users need guidance in identifying their needs, mapping those needs to possible tools, selecting a tool, and executing the packaging process successfully.
